## Project Overview

### React + Vite

These are React + vite projects, which include a Expense Tracker, Password Generator, TicTacToe game, and Todo Menu in one.

## Technologies

In this project I used:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript library for building user interfaces (version: 18.2.0)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) Utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building modern websites (version: 3.4.3)
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) Small library that helps you add icons (from all different icon libraries) to your React apps (version: 5.1.0)
- [React Switch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-switch) a type of UI component that allows users to toggle between two states (version: 7.0.0)

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/Aynebirhan/Reactjs_projects.git
npm install
```

Run app in development mode

```
npm run dev
```







This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
